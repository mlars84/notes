Not the bugs them self, but the way you think about them.

## Rejection adding up, time dragging on, external pressures:
  - Get help on how you feel / what's needed
      - good things will happen
  - Consistency in control-ables
  - Post-grad plan
      - momentum
  - Overall attitude and how you authentically present that.
  - Realistic, Achievable, measurable goals.
      - Don't always go it alone
  - CONNECT (in an authentic way)

### "Aim to Fail" advice
  - not intending to Fail
  - not the point, should succeed

### "Grit/resilience"
  - assumption of not enough
  - you don't know me / what I'm balancing
  - lacking somehow
  - discounting / get tough

### "Fixed vs Growth mindset"
  - fixed - intelligence is inherent / you can do it or you can't
  - growth - intelligence can be developed
